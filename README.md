## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The **snipping_bot** application is an advanced and specialized bot tailored for automating trading strategies on decentralized exchanges. Originally designed with PancakeSwap in mind, the bot's flexibility and modular design allows it to seamlessly integrate with other platforms, such as UniSwap. The underlying framework, Flask, offers a lightweight and efficient means to drive the application while providing extensibility for more advanced use-cases.

## Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>
### Multi-Chain Support <a name="multi-chain-support"></a>
The bot is equipped to handle multiple blockchain platforms:

- **PancakeSwap:** The default and primary platform.
- **UniSwap:** Ready for integration, demonstrating the bot's ability to adapt to different decentralized exchanges.

In the blockchain/chains/chain.py directory, users will discover classes developed to foster connections across a plethora of blockchain networks. To extend the bot's reach to other platforms, simply import the relevant factory and contract definitions from the blockchain/contracts/dex section.

### AWS Integration <a name="aws-integration"></a>
For bolstered security and enhanced automation:

- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS):** Empower your bot with advanced signature functionalities using KMS. Dive into `blockchain/utils/kmsaws.py` for utility functions dedicated to establishing connections with KMS.
- **AWS Lambda:** Specifically configured for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), this feature ensures swift and secure transaction signatures. The mechanics of the Lambda connection can be unraveled in `blockchain/utils/lambdaaws.py`. Further examples and details are housed in the repository 1234 (adjust placeholder as needed).

### Continuous Market Monitoring <a name="continuous-market-monitoring"></a>
Through the `run.py` script, the bot is always on its toes, scanning the market landscape every 60 seconds. Such relentless monitoring facilitates real-time decision-making and trade execution, all based on the strategies you set.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
- **Flask** *(Optional)* The beating heart of the bot.
- **AWS Account:** Essential for harnessing the might of KMS and Lambda.
- **Docker** *(Optional)*: If you aim to encapsulate the bot within a container, Docker is your go-to solution.

### Setting Up <a name="setting-up"></a>
- Get a local copy by cloning the repository.
- Make sure all the required dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
- For AWS functionalities, ensure your credentials are correctly input and authenticated.
- Tweak the `run.py` configuration, aligning it with your trading blueprint and preferred blockchain network.
- (Optional) If Docker is part of your plan, go ahead and build the container, then set it running.

## Recommendations <a name="recommendations"></a>
- Opt for Docker to run the bot. This not only ensures heightened security but also scales up performance metrics.
- While Flask does provide avenues to adjust configuration values on-the-fly, such practices are generally discouraged. It's always safer and more efficient to finalize configurations prior to deployment.

## Contribution & Support <a name="contribution--support"></a>
Community contributions are always welcome. Fork, modify, and then submit a pull request. If you stumble upon any challenges or have ideas to share, don't hesitate to open an issue in the repository.

It's imperative to underline that this bot, given its capabilities, demands meticulous configuration and supervision. It's a wise strategy to pilot test in a risk-free environment before any live deployment.
